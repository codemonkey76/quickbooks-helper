# Quickbooks Helper

PHP client wrapping the [Quickbooks PHP SDK](https://github.com/intuit/QuickBooks-V3-PHP-SDK).

## Installation

1. Install the package:

```bash
$ composer require codemonkey76/quickbooks-helper
```

2. Run our migration to install the `quickbooks_tokens` table:

```bash
php artisan migrate --package=codemonkey76/quickbooks-helper
```

The package uses the [auto registration feature](https://laravel.com/docs/packages#package-discovery) of Laravel.

## Configuration

1. You will need a ```quickBooksToken``` relationship on your ```User``` model.  There is a trait named ```Codemonkey76\QuickBooks\HasQuickBooksToken```, which you can include on your ```User``` model, which will setup the relationship. To do this implement the following:

Add ```use Codemonkey76\QuickBooks\HasQuickBooksToken;``` to at the top of User.php
and also add the trait within the class. For example:

```php
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable, HasQuickBooksToken;
```

**NOTE: If your ```User``` model is not ```App/User```, then you will need to configure the path in the ```configs/quickbooks.php``` as documented below.**

2. Add the appropriate values to your ```.env```

    #### Minimal Keys
    ```bash
    QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=<client id given by QuickBooks>
    QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>
    ```

    #### Optional Keys
    ```bash
    QUICKBOOKS_API_URL=<Development|Production> # Defaults to App's env value
    QUICKBOOKS_DEBUG=<true|false>               # Defaults to App's debug value
    ```

    3. _[Optional]_ Publish configs & views

    #### Config
    A configuration file named ```quickbooks.php``` can be published to ```config/``` by running...

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=quickbooks-config
    ```

    #### Views
    View files can be published by running...

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=quickbooks-views
    ```

## Usage

Here is an example of getting the company information from QuickBooks:

### NOTE: Before doing these commands, go to your connect route (default: /quickbooks/connect) to get a QuickBooks token for your user

```php
php artisan tinker
Psy Shell v0.11.2 (PHP 8.1.2 â€” cli) by Justin Hileman
>>> Auth::logInUsingId(1)
=> App\User {#1668
     id: 1,
     // Other keys removed for example
   }
>>> $quickbooks = app('Quickbooks')
=> Codemonkey76\QuickBooks\QuickbooksClient {#1613}
>>> $quickbooks->getDataService()->getCompanyInfo();
=> QuickBooksOnline\API\Data\IPPCompanyInfo {#1673
     +CompanyName: "Sandbox Company_US_1",
     +LegalName: "Sandbox Company_US_1",
     // Other properties removed for example
   }
>>>
```

You can call any of the resources as documented [in the SDK](https://intuit.github.io/QuickBooks-V3-PHP-SDK/quickstart.html).

## Using the included artisan commands

If you want to use the included artisan commands, you will need to provide the query to use to retrieve your data.
In your AppServiceProvider's boot method add your customer queries.
```php
QuickbooksHelper::setCustomerQuery(function() {
	return User::query()
	    ->with('client')
	    ->role(User::ROLE_APPROVED);
});

QuickbooksHelper::setCustomerFilter(function($query) {
	$query
	    ->has('orders')
	    ->whereNull('qb_customer_id')
	    ->where('sync_failed', '<', 3);
});
```
Once you have set the customerQuery and the customerFilter, you can then run the artisan command to sync customers with quickbooks.
```bash
php artisan qb:customer
```

In this provided example only customers that have orders and have not failed syncing more than 3 times and have not already been synced with quickbooks will be synced.
If you specify a customer to sync by ID like this:
```bash
php artisan qb:customer --id=123
```
The customer filter will be ignored, this enables you to update an existing customer that has already been synced.

Similarly to use the qb:invoice command you will also need to set the invoiceQuery and invoiceFilter, e.g.
```php
QuickbooksHelper::setInvoiceQuery(function() {
	return Order::query()
	    ->with(['user', 'items'])
	    ->whereHas('user', function ($q) {
	        $q->whereNotNull('qb_customer_id');
         })
        ->whereNotNull('paymentid');
});

QuickbooksHelper::setInvoiceFilter(function(&$query) {
	$query->where(function ($q) {
	    $q->whereNull('qb_invoice_id')
	    ->orWhereNull('qb_payment_id')
	    ->orWhere('sync', 1);
     })
     ->where('sync_failed', '<', 3)
});

```
## Middleware

If you have routes that will be dependent on the user's account having a usable QuickBooks OAuth token, there is an included middleware ```Codemonkey76\Quickbooks\Http\Middleware\QuickbooksConnected``` that gets registered as ```quickbooks``` that will ensure the account is linked and redirect them to the `connect` route if needed.

Here is an example route definition:

```php
Route::view('some/route/needing/quickbooks/token/before/using', 'some.view')
     ->middleware('quickbooks');
```
